Be it Ross and Rachel‚Äôs unforgettable wedding incident in the hit sitcom <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Friends</a>, or Jack and Joy tying the knot in What Happens in Vegas, a Vegas wedding can have some interesting results.</p><p data-characters=267 data-current-count=594 data-injectable=true>However, some of the more prominent celebrities have also retained the task of marking ‚ÄúSin City‚Äù on the map for being the ultimate destination for impromptu matchmaking. The most noteworthy of them is none other than the enormously talented <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nicolas Cage</a>.</p><p data-characters=317 data-current-count=317 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Wild at Heart star</a> reportedly entered into a much-talked-about marriage on March 23, 2019, with his girlfriend Erika Koike. However, the marriage lasted only four days, after which he filed for an annulment. Their marriage came to an abrupt end almost two months later when they were granted a divorce on May 31.</p><h2 id=h-who-is-erika-koike data-injectable=false><strong>Who is Erika Koike</strong>?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/erika-Koike.jpg><p data-characters=199 data-current-count=199 data-injectable=false>Erika Koike has earned a substantial amount of public recognition for being Hollywood superstar Nicolas Cage‚Äôs fourth wife and for being involved in a fleeting marital relationship on top of that.</p><p data-characters=230 data-current-count=429 data-injectable=true>She was born in 1985 which makes her 37 years old in 2022. She is credited for appearing in a 2012 short movie called Hankikanto.&nbsp; Apart from her very short acting career, she was a make-up artist before meeting Cage in 2018.</p><h2 id=h-the-wedding-and-annulment data-injectable=false><strong>The wedding and annulment</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=406 data-current-count=706 data-injectable=true>Cage and Koike reportedly started dating in April 2018 when they were spotted vacationing in Puerto Rico. The pair managed to keep their relationship private until their short, yet memorable, trip to Las Vegas. &nbsp;In 2019, both Cage and Koike were spotted in Vegas and only this time excessive partying and drinking constituted a major portion of their fun eventually leading to the duo getting hitched.</p><p data-characters=242 data-current-count=242 data-injectable=false>However, their marriage did not last. After four days, Cage submitted an application for annulment, adding them to the list of the shortest celebrity marriages following a less than two-day marriage between Britney Spears and Jason Alexander.</p><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=573 data-injectable=true>According to him, their marriage was not valid and there were several reasons for this claim. First, the Face/Off star stated that both of them had been <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‚Äúdrinking to the point of intoxication‚Äù</a> before they decided to marry, and as a result <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‚Äúlacked understanding‚Äù</a> of the weight of the situation they were getting involved in.</p><p data-characters=419 data-current-count=419 data-injectable=true>Other reasons also included revelations about Koike‚Äôs supposed boyfriend who was a ‚Äúdrug dealer‚Äù and Cage‚Äôs lack of awareness about her relationship with the other man. Other revelations include criminal charges especially domestic violence against her then-husband in 2006 and a neighbor leading to DUI charges against her. Reports stated that Koike hid her relationship and criminal history from Cage.</p><h3 id=h-how-did-koike-respond data-injectable=false><strong>How did Koike respond?</strong></h3><p data-characters=228 data-current-count=228 data-injectable=false>Things appeared to be less in Cage‚Äôs favor when Koike criticized his claims and appealed for spousal support. She is believed to not agree with Cage‚Äôs reasons for annulling the marriage thus adding further complications.</p><p data-characters=246 data-current-count=474 data-injectable=true>For providing spousal support of any kind, both Cage and Koike needed to be considered spouses, which did not line up well with Cage‚Äôs appeals for annulment. This started the divorce proceedings that the couple was granted after two months.</p><p data-characters=305 data-current-count=305 data-injectable=false>The results of the end of the marriage that received a large amount of media and public attention were not publicly revealed. No official statements were made with regard to whether any form of spousal support was provided to Koike by Cage except that following the divorce, both went their separate ways.</p><h2 id=h-where-are-they-now data-injectable=false><strong>Where are they now?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Nicolas-Cage-and-Riko-Shibata.jpg><p data-characters=244 data-current-count=244 data-injectable=false>Nearly four years after their marriage, fans are still interested in knowing about the relationship status of the actors. Not much information has been gathered about Koike apart from the fact that her relationship with Cage has ended for good.</p><p data-characters=308 data-current-count=552 data-injectable=true>It became clear that Cage had moved on when he was seen publicly holding hands with Riko Shibata, whom he later married in 2021, making Shibata his fifth wife. In 2022, it was reported that the pair were expecting a daughter. She was born on September 7, 2022, and her name is August Francesca Coppola Cage.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Congratulations! ü•Ç So cool that Mom and Baby will be closer in age than Mom and Dad. <a href=#>#specialbond</a> <a href=#>https://t.co/Tx4E7HNcBI</a></p>‚Äî Katherine Ryan (@Kathbum) <a href=#>April 22, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=162 data-current-count=462 data-injectable=true>However, not everyone reacted positively to this news, especially Katherine Ryan, who made a scathing sarcastic remark about the stark age gap between the couple.</p><p data-characters=180 data-current-count=180 data-injectable=false>In addition to being a father and husband, <a href=#>Cage continues to act</a> and has recently been in The Retirement Plan, Dream Scenario, and <a href=#>The Flash</a> (though in AI form in that last one).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZq6eZZujvLh5wJumrqxdmr%2Bqt8Bmoqihm5p6orrDZp%2Beql1peqWt2Gakmqqinq6osYytpmammZi8ra3SZpqan5Vk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
