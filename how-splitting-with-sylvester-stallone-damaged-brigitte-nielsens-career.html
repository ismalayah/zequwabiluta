A report by <a href=#>People</a> from 1987 noted that, while she had already been in the 1985 film "Red Sonja," doors opened for her after she married the "Rambo" star. She got a role in "Rocky IV," "Cobra," and "Beverly Hills Cop II," all in the span of three years, per her <a href=#>IMDb</a> credits. Referring to her former husband, the outlet argued that these were "jobs she almost certainly would not have gotten if she were still Mrs. Kasper Winding, wife of a Copenhagen musician."</p><p dir=ltr>But when Nielsen and Stallone separated, her career took a huge hit. "When I left Sylvester, all doors closed on me," Nielsen said on <a href=#>OWN</a> in June 2014. "No one wanted to touch me and I was basically blacklisted. So I was forced to go back to Europe. Thank God I had so much work, speaking four languages: Danish, German, Italian, [and English]. Being able to work in all these different languages basically made me survive and I've done a lot of good stuff over there." While it's great that Nielsen was able to make the most of it back in Europe, that couldn't have been easy having to pack up and leave. In light of all of this, it makes sense that she's so full of regret about marrying Stallone.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlpZn51gY6hprBlo6W5qsDToqWgZaeewal50rKjr52jqbKzedKtmKWkn6OybrDAppignZRir7O1xqKrrZ1do7amuNKepaxlk5a%2FprHRaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
