Mean In Text?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Pushing ? in the text means positivity. If a person is Pusing P, it means they are keeping it real, and the person is acting appropriately.</p><p>The viral Pushing ? started a few days before Gunna dropped his new album DS4EVER. He started talking about pushing P on Instagram and Twitter. He was very mysterious about the meaning of ? and asked his fans to make a guess.</p><p>Gunna had beef with Freddie Gibbs, where he brought it up again. He teased an incoming Freddie diss song and tweeted using the phrase Pushing ? again. The rapper went on a rant and used the phrase P in the context, reports&nbsp;Complex.</p><p>Just like that, a new phrase, Pushing P, got popularized in the mainstream. The term had been in use in places such as Texas and Bay Area for years. But now, it is being used on the internet and social media sites such as TikTok, Instagram, and Twitter along with an emoji.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=pushing-meaning-in-urban-dictionary-revealed></span>Pushing ? Meaning In Urban Dictionary Revealed<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In&nbsp;Urban Dictionary, Pushing ? means keeping it real. Anything good is referred to as Pushing, whereas anything negative or not good is referred to as not Pushing.</p><p>P just does not mean player, and it can mean anything such as paper. There is also an important and unavoidable difference between Pushing P and Kicking P.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=pushing-slang-meaning-and-definition-revealed></span>Pushing ? Slang Meaning And Definition Revealed<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Pushing started as a substitution for the word Player, but now it is fairly flexible. Pushing ? is indeed slang. Gunna recently took Instagram Live to talk about the meaning and definition of P.</p><p>He said that if a person holds the door for another person, thatâ€™s P, whereas if you argue with your friend about money, that is not P. He further explained that we are not doing that, and we are Pushing P.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKyZoMGwt4ywn5qsXZm8pr%2BMqaysoJmjtG5xpWlccn5VbYJmjqVmpJ6ZnmK2r3nTnq%2BtZZGjsW7B0ZuYp2WUnrC1tc6nmKuxXai5orrGZqSemZ6eu6h5w56doqaZqbawuo4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
