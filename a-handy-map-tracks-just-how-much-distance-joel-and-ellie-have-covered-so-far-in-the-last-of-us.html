And apparently, HBO anticipated this, especially for international viewers who are not familiar with US geography. And knowing that the USA has 50 states, it wouldn’t be a surprise if people are completely lost on where they are in the show in terms of location.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=387 data-current-count=387 data-injectable=false>Throughout the entire The Last of Us journey, a map of where our two main characters are is shared on Instagram by @HBOMaxNordic, the official HBO Max account for nordic viewers like Finland, Denmark, and Iceland, just to name a few. This week, the map was updated to feature a new mark at Boulder, Colorado, where the two currently reside as Joel tries to recover from a recent attack.</p><p data-characters=272 data-current-count=659 data-injectable=true>The last time the map was updated was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">back two weeks ago</a> when both Joel and Ellie were in Kansas during episodes four and five. So it’s a handy tool for those who want to visualize the journey of these two characters and why walking to each state would take forever.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by HBO Max Nordic (@hbomaxnordic)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=552 data-current-count=852 data-injectable=true>You can see how far our characters have gone since the start of the series. Like the whole show began in Texas before Joel became a smuggler in Boston. Then he and Ellie took a long road trip by car from Lincon to Kansas City. At the same time, this map could give context as to why <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">US viewers called bullsh*t on the geography back in episode three</a>, when the show claimed that our characters were “10 miles west from Boston.” In the end, this could be a good educational tool for those who want to know more about America’s geography.</p><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=282 data-injectable=false>Fortunately, Joel and Ellie don’t have a long way to go before making their way to Salt Lake City in Utah. But based on what was shown in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">episode eight trailer</a>, it seems like Ellie has to deal with another roadblock before she and Joel can make their way to the Fireflies.</p><p data-characters=89 data-current-count=371 data-injectable=false>New episodes of The Last of Us drop every Sunday at 6 pm PT / 9 pm ET on HBO and HBO Max.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yieceapZ2xXaKusXnTq5ico6Nit7a%2F02afqK9dosKktIydoKyskaOwpnnJqJylZZGjsW6xy6WgnmWYlsOmecKorZ6qlZl6tLuMn5irZZmjerW0xGajmqukYrynedSsZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
