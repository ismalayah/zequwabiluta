Deztin Pryor, having a full-fledged conversation with his 18-month-old son, Kingston Jierre, is getting the attention that it deserves online. You will understand why viewers cannot stop watching the clip once you see the footage for the first time.</p><p>In the video, recorded by the child’s mother Shanieke Pryor, Deztin hangs out on the sofa while watching the season finale of Empire. The comedian’s son is also present and decides to have a conversation about the episode.</p><p>“They need to work on that, right,” the father says to his son. The little one replies by saying. “Yes.” DJ Pryor then asks, “Did you understand it, though.” His son admittedly says, “No.”</p><p>Only this child!! Having a full-fledged conversation with Daddy and Daddy is just as bad🤣🤣#TheseTwoAreAMess #OurHouseisAlwaysFullofLaughter #MrPersonality #HeNeedsHisOwnShow #KingstonJierre #KJPIG @nikispryor</p><p>Posted by <a href=# role=button>Shanieke Pryor</a> on Tuesday, 4 June 2019</p><p>Still, even with a limited understanding of what was taking place on the small screen, Kingston, renders his opinion about the matters at hand. The little one uses hand gestures to convey his thoughts to dad. “That’s exactly what I was thinking,” the comedian father exclaims. “We think a lot alike,” Pryor concludes.</p><p>Shanieke found the interaction between her husband and son to be incredibly hilarious. “Only this child,” the mother said of her son. “Having a full-fledged conversation with Daddy, and Daddy is just as bad,” Shanieke mused.” #TheseTwoAreAMess.”</p><p>More than one million Facebook viewers shared the cute interaction, which led to massive notoriety for Kingston and his dad. “Y’all, watch this baby have a full d*mn convo with his daddy,” one Twitter fan shared along with the video. “I’ve probably watched this WAY too many times today,” another social media fan said. Even Bernice King, daughter of the late Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., commented on the adorable video. “This was good for me today,” the activist said.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>This was good for me today. ❤️ <a href=#>https://t.co/2yD97M2IyY</a></p><p>— Be A King (@BerniceKing) <a href=#>June 6, 2019</a></p><p>With a personality as big and cute as Kingston’s, there is no telling where this kid is headed.
