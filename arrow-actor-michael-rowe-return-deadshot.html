But since Smith won’t be returning for the sequel to Suicide Squad, the actor has expressed interest in reprising his role as Floyd Lawton.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=731 data-current-count=731 data-injectable=true>Most fans would agree that David Ayer’s 2016 movie was a convoluted mess, and ultimately, a missed opportunity. That being said, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Smith’s Deadshot was undeniably one of the things that made&nbsp;Suicide Squad&nbsp;tolerable</a>. But before there were plans to cast the legendary actor in the role, Michael Rowe portrayed Lawton as one of Oliver Queen’s first enemies in Starling City. He then continued to reprise his part several times as an agent of A.R.G.U.S. and a member of the Suicide Squad. As a matter of fact, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">there were even plans to develop a spinoff show centering around the character</a>, but with Will Smith coming along, the producers had to kill him off, leading to his apparent death by an explosion in season 3.</p><p data-characters=191 data-current-count=191 data-injectable=false>However, since Will Smith won’t be returning for James Gunn’s The Suicide Squad, Rowe has revealed in a new interview that he’d love to return as Deadshot in the Arrowverse.</p><p>“The fact that Will Smith doesn’t seem to be doing anymore, it might be a greater chance of coming back, but honestly, I have no idea,” Rowe said. “I haven’t been in those conversations, so I don’t really know what goes on. If they wanted to do it and I was free, I’d love to do it. I love playing that character. And I know we had fancy plans for him, but we never got to them, so it feels like unfinished business.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ar810b_0541b-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ar810b_0438b.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ar810a_0055b.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ar810b_0197b.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ar810b_0087b.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ar810b_0135b.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ar810b_0032b.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ar810b_0154b.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ar810b_0394b.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ar810c_0147b.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ar810c_0123b.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ar810c-0169b-1203727.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ar810c-0188b-1203715.jpeg><p data-characters=128 data-current-count=319 data-injectable=false>The actor also explained why it’s so difficult to get his character back into The CW’s multiverse of heroes, saying:</p><p>“It certainly popped into my mind when I saw that they were going to do Suicide Squad, I was like, ‘uh-oh, I’m definitely in trouble.’ Then I got the call. Yep, definitely. Okay. That happened as planned.”</p><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=702 data-injectable=true>Rowe had a brief flashback sequence in season 5, but apparently, the producers had to ask for WB’s permission to put him on just for a couple of minutes. Meanwhile, Gunn initially cast Idris Elba to portray Floyd Lawton again in the sequel, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">but the studio eventually decided to have him play a new character</a> so as to give Smith the opportunity to return in future installments.</p><p data-characters=170 data-current-count=170 data-injectable=false>Of course, with&nbsp;<strong>Arrow&nbsp;</strong>coming to a close this year after eight seasons, if Rowe gets to come back one day, the producers will have to find him a new home on Earth-Prime.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yivtGormaZk6m8s3nMopqhmZWherO71p5kq52kqr%2BvecOemJ2rmKTBcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
