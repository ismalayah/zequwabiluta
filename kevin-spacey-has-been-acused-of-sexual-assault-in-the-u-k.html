Following an examination of Met Police evidence from complaints submitted between 2005 and 2013, five charges were issued against the 62-year-old.&nbsp;Three of the complaints were about claimed sexual abuse in London, and one was about alleged sexual abuse in Gloucestershire.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Kevin Spacey was first accused of sexual misconduct in 2017 by actor Anthony Rapp, who said Spacey made a sexual advance toward him at a party in 1986, when Rapp was 14 and Spacey was 26. More than a dozen others came forward against Spacey after Rapp. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/dPeS3ysYRD</a></p><p>— Keith Boykin (@keithboykin) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">May 26, 2022</a></p><h2>Sexual assault charges against Kevin Spacey</h2><p>The first two accusations originate from an alleged sexual attack in London in March 2005 by a man in his 40s, while the second victim, a man in his 30s, was assaulted in London in August 2008. In the instance of the second alleged victim, though, Spacey is also charged with inciting a person to engage in penetrative sexual intercourse without their permission.</p><p>The third complainant is a guy in his thirties from Gloucestershire who was assaulted in April 2013. While the CPS has approved charges against Mr. Spacey, it is thought that he has not been legally charged since he is not in the country.&nbsp;According to Rosemary Ainslie, director of the CPS Special Crime Division, the CPS “approved criminal charges against Kevin Spacey, 62, for four counts of sexual assault against three individuals” after assessing the evidence.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Kevin-Spacey-2.jpg alt="Kevin Spacey" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She stated:</p><p>“The Crown Prosecution Service wishes to remind everyone that criminal proceedings against Mr Spacey are ongoing and that he has the right to a fair trial.”</p><p>The CPS, on the other hand, indicated that it couldn’t confirm or deny whether Mr. Spacey, an American, would be necessary to be extradited to the UK.&nbsp;Kevin Spacey, 62, was interviewed by British police in 2019 after numerous individuals said he attacked them.&nbsp;His great career ended in 2017 after actor Anthony Rapp accused him of sexually abusing him at a party when Rapp was a teenager in the 1980s. Spacey categorically rejects the charges.</p><p>The allegations were revealed as Spacey was testifying in Rapp’s civil lawsuit in a New York City courtroom. On Thursday, he was on the witness stand and could not be contacted for comment.&nbsp;However, in 2019, Massachusetts prosecutors dropped a criminal case against him for indecent assault and battery in connection with the alleged groping of an 18-year-old male at a Nantucket resort.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Kevin-Spacey-3.jpg alt="Kevin Spacey" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>All About Kevin Spacey</h2><p>Spacey was born in New Jersey on July 26, 1959.
