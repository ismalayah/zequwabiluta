According to the item’s description, it’s a synced emote. That means that more than one player can perform the emote in sync. In this case, up to four people can play different instruments such as drums and a variety of guitars. If it’s used in-game, the character will pull out an instrument and perform ‘Master of Puppets.’</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=377 data-current-count=677 data-injectable=true>Metallica only recently opened up to the idea of sharing their music license with other brands, remarking they don’t care&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">it doesn’t care if it makes them a “sellout.”</a>&nbsp;Metallica went on to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">incorporate that iconic Eddie Munson scene</a>&nbsp;in the performance of ‘Master of Puppets’ in their live act after the song was played in&nbsp;Stranger Things.</p><p data-characters=267 data-current-count=267 data-injectable=false>Eddie Munson’s actor, Joseph Quinn, got to meet Metallica backstage during Lollapalooza earlier this year, as well.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The band released a video</a>&nbsp;of the meet-up where the two jammed backstage and gave Quinn a signed electric guitar similar to the one in the show.</p><p data-characters=199 data-current-count=466 data-injectable=false>Now, thanks to this new Fortnite emote, you too can pull off what Eddie did in the show and simply riff your enemies away.
