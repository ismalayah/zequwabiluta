The duo soon became inseparable and reunited for Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Corpse Bride, Sweeney Todd, Alice in Wonderland and Dark Shadows over the next two decades.</p><p data-characters=529 data-current-count=529 data-injectable=true>Burton and Depp haven’t worked together for eight years, which is the longest they’ve gone without enjoying each other’s company, but as soon as it was announced that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Mars Attacks! director was developing a new TV show</a> based on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>The Addams Family</strong></a>, the former Pirates of the Caribbean star <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">quickly became a fan favorite choice</a> to play patriarch Gomez. And now, we have some new fan art that imagines how Depp and Eva Green could look as blissfully wedded duo Gomez and Morticia, which you can check out below.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/depp-green-addams-family.jpg><p data-characters=503 data-current-count=503 data-injectable=false>Of course, there’ve also been a lot of fans <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">voicing their support for Oscar Isaac as Gomez</a>, and the actor already brought the character to life in last year’s animated hit, although he’ll soon be busy with another small screen exclusive having entered talks for the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s Moon Knight. Johnny Depp might seem like too obvious a candidate to lead Tim Burton’s <strong>Addams Family</strong>, but it also can’t be denied that he’d be a great fit for the role.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ypsdGeqmain527r8WMnZypqF2ptq55wa6praeeqHqisMOapKxllpa6qrjYaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
