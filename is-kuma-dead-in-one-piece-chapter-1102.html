I’ve got you covered. Read the entire <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">One Piece</a></strong> Egghead arc in one go and get ready to bawl your eyes out, especially because of Kuma.</p><p data-characters=405 data-current-count=598 data-injectable=true>For years, we’ve been aware of Oda’s remarkable <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ability to reduce grown men to tears</a>. Still, none of us could have anticipated that the Egghead arc would be one of those times. As we delve into Kuma’s heartbreaking past as a slave, and witness his undying <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">devotion to his daughter and Ginny,</a> we realize that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the word “tyrant” </a>never truly described the kindest character in One Piece.</p><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=356 data-injectable=false>However, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">in Chapter 1102</a>, we’re hit with the realization that everything we thought we knew about the Pacifista, up until now, was a lie. He was always fully aware of his actions, until his free will was stripped away from him after Marineford. This begs the question: does this mean that Kuma is, in fact, dead, and that his body is merely a weapon?</p><h2 id=h-is-kuma-dead-in-one-piece data-injectable=false>Is Kuma dead in One Piece?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bartholomew-Kuma-One-Piece.png><p data-characters=377 data-current-count=377 data-injectable=false>All in all, the simplest way to answer this is that he is mentally dead, but physically alive. Ultimately, Kuma’s status comes down to what you would consider to be “alive.” While Kuma’s body exists, even if it is used as a weapon, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">his free will and humanity are taken away from him</a> the moment Saturn orders Vegapunk to turn Kuma into a puppet in chapter 1102.</p><p data-characters=400 data-current-count=777 data-injectable=true>Now, you may be wondering, “But where did his free will go?” Unfortunately, I don’t have an answer for you. We don’t know that either. There is a small chance that Vegapunk has managed to store Kuma’s “soul” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the same way they stored his memories</a>; however, in the end, it all seems to point to the fact that Kuma is nothing but a body. Therefore, he might be considered dead.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Imu-one-piece1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Imu-one-piece-straw-hat.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Imu-One-Piece.jpg><p data-characters=373 data-current-count=373 data-injectable=false>In the end, we still have no exact answer from Oda on whether Kuma is alive or dead. Or, better yet, whether there is a chance that he would ever regain his conscience. Per the One Piece Wikia, many fans consider him to be alive, purely because his body is still intact — even if he is more of a robot than a human. After all, this was Saturn’s intention all along.</p><p data-characters=236 data-current-count=609 data-injectable=false>For now, all we know is that this insight into his life has truly changed our entire notion of the entire series. And if you want to have your world shattered, the new One Piece chapter 1102 will be released on Viz Media on December 24.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6iqmajpaKubrDEmptmoZ5ivK%2BxjKmgnpuVYrCprc%2BtnKtlYWZ9c3s%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
