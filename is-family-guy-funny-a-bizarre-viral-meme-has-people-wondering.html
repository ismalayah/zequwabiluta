In the modern era, memes have replaced emails as the “vessel” for chain letters, which are so outrageous that they become worldwide trends.</p><p data-characters=418 data-current-count=731 data-injectable=true>On Twitter, the original tweet has garnered over 14,000 likes, 1,450 retweets and over 9,000 replies and features an image of Chris Griffin with blood trickling from white-out eyes with his hand on the shoulder of a sobbing Meg Griffin. Above the brother-sister duo, the following message reads: “This post is cursed. If you don’t comment “Family Guy is funny,” you will die in 24 hours.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=und dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/4N6R8T39vW</a></p>— +dogλe tec (@Dog2e11400) <a href=#>June 2, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=467 data-current-count=767 data-injectable=true>Somehow, in some way, the meme became a viral trend. Now, “Family Guy is funny” is trending on global Twitter, but no one quite understands why. Either way, the meme managed to prompt a debate surrounding whether or not Family Guy is genuinely funny. Having just aired the 20 episodes in its 20th season, Family Guy has been questioned in recent years, with many viewers (diehard fans or not) believing that the animated sitcom could have lost its touch.</p><p data-characters=292 data-current-count=292 data-injectable=false>Family Guy has been airing since 1999, so how long can recycled storylines last and remain entertaining and funny? Some comments argue that the first seven seasons are funny, but after that, the series becomes tiresome and repetitive. It can be argued that, honestly, they’re not wrong.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=592 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>family guy is funny. im not afraid to say i laugh at the cutaway gags.</p>— yeah, danlabs.

Although Family Guy is considered funny by many, there are others who recognize its brilliance but argue that rival animated sitcoms—like The Simpsons and South Park—are better.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>I see Family Guy is Funny trending, and while I agree, I will always die on the hill that American Dad is funnier. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/zdy30ltPLU</a></p>— W.M.

Its first ever episode, “Death Has a Shadow,” aired on January 31, 1999, meaning that Seth McFarlane’s 389-episode brainchild has been cranking out content for over 23 years. Right now, there’s no word on whether or not another season is in the works, but there have been no announcements that suggest the contrary—which would be the sitcom’s end. Judging by how popular Family Guy appears to be, even decades later, there is still a market for crude humor and cutaway gags.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8isZJ%2BZnZ65unnGrrBmnqWju7p5wGaZorKRp7%2BmedWiqZqkXaKyrrGMoZisZaCavLG4xGauqKaUmr%2BqusZo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
