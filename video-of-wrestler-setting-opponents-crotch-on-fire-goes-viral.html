Pro Wrestling Trainwreck held a show recently that featured one spot which got a ton of attention.</p><p>A video clip of one wrestler setting another on fire has gone viral. One video received over 1 million views and tons of responses. This was not just any normal spot where a wrestler sets his opponent on fire either.</p><p>This clip shows a wrestler allowing his opponent set his crotch on fire. Then the man on fire remained still as his opponent fetched a weed wacker to nail him one more time right in the bathing suit area.</p><p>This was a hard spot for a lot of people to watch, to say the least. It also received a ton of criticism from fans who don’t appreciate this brand of deathmatch wrestling. It was certainly a crazy clip. Needless to say, Jim Cornette was tagged in this video many times.</p><p>You can check out a couple of angles of the spot below. We must warn you that it’s pretty hard to watch.</p><p><strong>Did this spot go too far?
