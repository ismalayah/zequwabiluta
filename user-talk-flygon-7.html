This is not acceptable on Bulbapedia. It may seem totally reasonable to you, but we still do <i>not</i> make such assumptions; we <i>wait</i> for some sort of official confirmation.</p><p>If you do have some source, please let me know what it is. <a href=# title=User:Tiddlywinks>Tiddlywinks</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:Tiddlywinks">talk</a>) 23:37, 5 May 2016 (UTC)</p>Those were not assumptions. I am a Spanish guy and I got my code and my own Yveltal, so just took the info from there. If you need some screenshots as proof just ask for them&nbsp;:). If there is no problem I'll leave the info as I wrote it before. --<a href=# class=new title="User:Flygon 7 (page does not exist)">Flygon 7</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink" href=#>talk</a>) 00:36, 6 May 2016 (UTC) OK. There are at least two apparent problems with what you originally edited, then. First, the ID probably <i>shouldn't</i> be the same as it was for Zygarde. It would be great if you could double-check that. Secondly, unless you captured the Wonder Card technical data or looked directly at Yveltal's—or maybe hacked Yveltal to make it a lower level—you probably can't be sure that Yveltal's moves are actually relearnable (since they're all level-up moves and Yveltal is level 100). If you're not actually certain, please don't assume they are. <a href=# title=User:Tiddlywinks>Tiddlywinks</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:Tiddlywinks">talk</a>) 00:43, 6 May 2016 (UTC) The ID is oddly correct, and I just took a look at its info using PkHex and the 4 moves are marked as "Egg moves". --<a href=# class=new title="User:Flygon 7 (page does not exist)">Flygon 7</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink" href=#>talk</a>) 00:48, 6 May 2016 (UTC) Hm, that is odd. Thanks for checking both those things. And sorry for the mistake, then. <a href=# title=User:Tiddlywinks>Tiddlywinks</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:Tiddlywinks">talk</a>) 00:50, 6 May 2016 (UTC)<h2><span class=mw-headline id=Shiny_Yveltal_event>Shiny Yveltal event</span></h2><p>I noticed above you said that you got your own code for it. So I am wondering if there is any way you could get a scan (or a picture if you can't get a scan) of its serial code card for the PAL region serial code page? <b><a href=# title="User:Lady Ariel"><span>Lady</span></a> <a href=# title="User talk:Lady Ariel"><span>Ariel</span></a></b> 03:05, 6 May 2016 (UTC)</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Anime_moves>Anime moves</span></h2><p>I see you're removing anime moves that aren't identified, but I just want to make sure that you're checking closed captions which at times do identify moves that aren't vocally identified.</p><p>Also, it may be that some moves not on Force Fire's user page can still be argued to be unique. If you're not already, you may want to consider that possibility before culling just everything not on that list. <a href=# title=User:Tiddlywinks>Tiddlywinks</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:Tiddlywinks">talk</a>) 04:02, 22 July 2017 (UTC)</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=In_other_languages>In other languages</span></h2><p>Hello there! I noticed that you have been adding the Spanish names for the areas in Pokémon Rumble U, that's very nice! However you seem to make a distinction between the article's name and the other's. That is a distinction that we don't generally do here. Therefore I ask of you to not make that distinction in future edits and simply use ''&lt;name>'' on all names and not just the article's. Thank you. --<a href=# title=User:Raltseye><span>R</span><span>alts</span><span>eye</span></a> <a href=# title="User talk:Raltseye">prata med mej</a> 10:04, 1 March 2018 (UTC)</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Fling_powers>Fling powers</span></h2><p>In 2017, <a href=# title=Special:Diff/2609919>you added</a> several items' Fling powers to the <a href=# title="Fling (move)">Fling</a> page. On <a href=# title="Talk:Protective Pads">Talk:Protective Pads</a>, someone is disputing the power of Protective Pads that you added. Where did you get the powers from?

As Lost Thunder is a large expansion, I hope that the pages won't be moved and edited unless you have all the information for the cards. Things to edit to the English version:</p><ul><li>Removing the TCG Unreleased tag</li><li>PokémoncardInfobox</li><li>Changing Thunderclap Spark/Fairy Rise/Super-Burst Impact/SM-P Promotional to Lost Thunder in the "It is part of [name] expansion" sentence</li><li>The <b>attack</b>s and <b>description</b> <b>IN ENGLISH</b></li><li>transdex to dex</li><li>Category:Lost Thunder cards</li><li>Release information (when applicable)</li></ul><p>I realized from previous expansions that you have missed several of the parts, and I had to go through the whole set to spot out the mistakes/those left out. As Lost Thunder is a very large set, I do not wish to have to check through all the card pages again. Also, this information will also be applicable to future English expansions.
